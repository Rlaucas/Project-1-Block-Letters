# Project-1-Block-Letters
This is the first project for the Introduction to Computer Programming (winter 2023)

Dear students,

ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from individual characters.

Project Overview
In this project, you will write a Python program called initials.py; if you use VSCode, that displays your name's initials in block letters as shown in the attached document and dip your toes into ASCII art.

Your project must include the following:
1. You must write two comments with your first and last name a fun fact about yourself.
2. Output your first initial as a block letter. There are a few ways to do this!
3. Output your second initial as a block letter by adding to the print() statements.
4. Your block letters must match those in the attached Block Letters Sample (5 x 7).

Please click on the links below to learn more about ASCII art, and view the alphabet in block letters.
Finally, I recommend you find this assignment in Google Classroom for more details.
